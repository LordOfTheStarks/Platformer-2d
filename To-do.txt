in Main/Game.java
GameState includes OPTIONS, but Game.update() and Game.render() do not handle it. That explains why clicking “Options” leads to “nothing shows up” — the state changes to OPTIONS, but there is no update/draw path for OPTIONS, so you get a blank screen and no UI rendered. (Done - Boray)
