Repo is updated 
Now, I want to add some critical stuff. 
1. I want to change the character sprite, there are a lot of sheets in this sprite zip but i will only use a few:

- _Attack.png for normal attacks(1 click only) (480x80 with 4 states)
- _AttackCombo.png for 2+ mouse clicks (1200x80 with 12 states)
- _Fall.png for when falling (360x80 with 3 states)
- _Idle.png for staying still (1200x80 with 12 states)
- _Jump.png for jumping (360x80 with 3 states)
- _Run.png for running/moving (1200x80 with 12 states)
